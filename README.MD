## 3. Project Overview:

This project follows the Behavior-Driven Development (BDD) methodology to make it more accessible to the entire team, including those unfamiliar with technical terminology. The combination of Gherkin with Cucumber has been employed to enable test automation in the Cypress environment.

The chosen application is 'todomvc.com', allowing the visualization of tests through an intuitive interface, facilitating interaction with Cypress. This approach not only promotes effectiveness in test execution but also strengthens collaborative understanding of the project.
